									5th frets Mark Harris was a young man. We would find broken, dirty, and neglected guitars, repairing and restoring them from a sofa in our conservatory. Then, as we began to work with a wider range of guitars, and experiment with more complicated issues, we discovered that the tools and skills needed for properly conduct the repairs were vast. Luckily for us, we live in an age where information is very easily available, and we found the answers we needed either online or from a variety of sources such as luthier manuals and manuscripts. The glass table was no longer sufficient to hold the velocity of work, and so we moved the kitchen table into the conservatory, and worked from there.

									  We continued to practise and study the art of guitar repairs and customisation, and worked hard to raise the money for the proper equipment and supplies needed for such specialist work. Faced with an enormous range of skills to learn and master, we worked long hours through day and night, often without days off. We began to advertise our services in the local newsagents and supermarket, and started receiving the odd repair job here and there. Widening our knowledge and skill set in guitar repairs allowed us to buy more and more guitars, discovering that there is very little that cannot be fixed with the right methodology and craftsmanship. The only thing holding us back was the work space, and so for six months we worked diligently to raise the money to build ourselves a workshop. With the help of a good friend, our new workshop was raised from nothing in the space of five weeks. Then, with a new fantastic workspace, our work grew exponentially, allowing us to take in more and more repairs, and providing us with the perfect environment in which to master the art of guitar repair.

									It is truly a joy to work on instruments for a profession, and we take each job very seriously, working carefully with each instrument. Both Mark and I are lifelong guitarists and musicians and therefore have a wide understand and respect for the guitar. We work hard not only to perfect our own craft, but to ensure that we can also provide you with advice or information about brands and products, styles and types of instruments, or other such elements. We are passionate with restoring old or valuable guitars back to their original glory, as well as customising your instrument to suit your styles and preferences.
